## Polyomino Games

A puzzle game built with Unity, to explore a concept.
See [blog](http://www.polyomino.com).

See [blog](http://www.polyomino.com/category/looptwo/) for some thoughts on Loop the Game, and the difficulty in generating levels for games of this kind.

See [Strange Loops](https://david-pfx.github.io/strange-loops/WebGL) for the game that came out of it. Joining up loops on a hex grid. Already very hard at the highest levels, but still a work in progress.
