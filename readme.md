## Polyomino Games

A game built with Unity.
See [blog](http://www.polyomino.com).

See [blob](http://www.polyomino.com/category/looptwo/) for some pondering on Loop the Game, and how to make games of this kind.

See [Strange Loops](https://david-pfx.github.io/Polyomino/strange-loops) for the game that came out of it. Joining up loops on a hex grid. Very hard at the highest levels, but still a work in progress.
